\section{Notation}
\label{sec-1}

Each location $i \in \mathcal{L}$ lies in a $R^2$ at coordinate pair
$C_i$.  The matrix $\Omega$ is a binary matrix indicating adjacent
locations.  For any two locations $i$ and $j$, $\Omega_{i,j} = 1$ if
location $j$ is adjacent to location $i$.  We define the network such
that locations are adjacenty to themselves, $\Omega_{i,i} = 1$ for all
$i$.  All networks defined will be undirected thus $\Omega_{i,j} =
\Omega_{j,i}$ for all $i,j$.  The adjacency matrix is the defining
component of the network.  For some of the networks, the adjacency
matrix can be defined without knowing the coordinate pairs, but for
other networks the coordinate pairs are required to generate the
adjacency matrix.  Regardless of the network, we outline every step to
generate the network in its entirety.

When defining networks, some additonal notation may be added to keep
the process clear and concise.

To model the spread of the disease, we assume that once a location
becomes infected, it remains infected thereafter.  The infection
status for location $i$ at time $t$ is $X_{i,t} = 1$ if infected and
$X_{i,t} = 0$ otherwise.  Thus $X_{i,t} \ge X_{i,t'}$ for all $t > t'$.

Let the subscript operator $[\cdot]$ denote the usual order
statistics; let $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ denote the floor operator; let
$\lceil \cdot \rceil$ denote the ceiling operator.


\section{System dynamics model}
\label{sec-2}

\subsection{Gravity model}
\label{sec-2-1}

To model the evolution of the disease, we model the probability that
an infected location $i$ infects an uninfected location $j$ at time
point $t$.  We denote this probability as $p_{i,j,t}$.  If we assume
independence across events $i$ infecting $j$ and $i'$ infecting $j$,
the probability of $j$ becoming infected at time $t$ is
\begin{equation*}
  P(X_{j,t} = 1 | X_{\cdot,t-1}) = X_{j,t-1} \bigvee \left[1 - \prod_{i:
  X_{i,t-1} = 1} ( 1 - p_{i,j,t} ) \right].
\end{equation*}

To define $p_{i,j,t}$ we use a form of the gravity model.
\begin{equation*}
  \logit \; p_{i,j,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 U_j 
  - \alpha \frac{d_{i,j}}{(c_ic_j)^\nu} - \eta g_j(\tau_{i,t})
  - \rho A_{j,t-1} - \gamma A_{i,t-1}
\end{equation*}
where $\tau_{i,t} = \sum_{t' = 0}^t X_{i,t'}$ is the number of time
points $i$ has been infected.  We compare different forms of
$g_j(\cdot)$ discussed later.  The name of the model comes from
$d_{i,j}/(c_i,c_j)^\nu$ which is known as the gravity term.  The
effect of distance between two locations is diminished if the number
of caves in the two locations is large.  We assume as the number of
caves increases, so does the number of bats effectively decreasing the
effect of distance.  The vector $U_j$ is a vector of covariates as
part of the state information.  These covariates include the number of
caves, average winter length, area, species richness, and number of
hibernating bat species.

For model estimation, we use a Bayesian framework.  The priors on the
parameters are as follows $\beta_0 \sim N(0,100)$, $\beta_1 \sim
N(0,10)$, $\log(\alpha) \sim N(0,1)$, $\log(\nu) \sim N(0,1)$.  The
priors for $\rho$ and $\gamma$ will be specified later.  For WNS, the
observed data does not include information about treatments.  This
requires an ad-hoc selection of the true treatment effects.  The prior
distributions during the simulations for these parameters will over
estimate the true effect.

\subsection{Model fit diagnostics}
\label{sec-2-2}

When estimating the posterior distributions, we compared multiple
forms for $g(\cdot)$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item ``zero'': $g_j(x) = 0$
  \item ``linear'': $g_j(x) = x - 1$
  \item ``exp'': $g_j(x) = exp(x - 1) - 1$
  \item ``exp\_caves'': $g_j(x) = exp(\frac{\max_k c_k+1}{c_j + 1}(x - 1)) - 1$
\end{itemize}


The table below shows the Bayesian P-value for each of the four
transformations above.  Using an exponential transformation greatly
improves the estimated p-values.  Going forward, we choose the
``exp\(\_\)caves'' transformation as providing the best fit.

\subsection{Structures}
\label{sec-3-1}

\subsubsection{Random Network}
\label{sec-3-1-1}

For each location $i=1,\ldots,L$, $C_i \sim \lbrace U(0,1)\rbrace^2$.
To determine which locations are connected, we must first define some
notation.  Let $E_{i,j} = \|C_{i} - C_{j}\|_2$.  The set of $k$ nearby
locations to location $i$ is $N^{(k)}_i = \lbrace j : E_{i,j} \le
E_{i,[k+1]} \rbrace$.  Note the detail $[k+1]$ which is a consequence
of $E_{i,i} = 0$.  The adjacency matrix is defined as $\Omega_{i,j} =
1$ if $i \in N_{j}^{(k)}$ or $j \in N_{i}^{(k)}$.

\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Starred Alley}
\label{sec-3-1-2}

For a starred alley of size $L$, define
\begin{equation*}
  m_L= \underset{m > 0}{\arg\max} \; f(m) \mathds{1}_{\lbrace f(m) \le L
    \rbrace }
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
  f(m) = m + \left\lceil \frac{m}{2}
  \right\rceil 
  \left(\left\lceil \frac{m}{2} \right\rceil
    - (m \text{ mod } 2) + 1 \right).
\end{equation*}

Let locations $1,\ldots,m_L$ index the locations on the main
horizontal line.  Next define disjoint sets of locations
$N_i$ for \$i = 1,\ldots,m$_{\text{L}}$.  The cardinality for
$N_i$ is defined as
\begin{equation*}
  | N_i | = \left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor +
  \mathds{1}_{\lbrace(m_L - i) < (L - f(m_L))\rbrace}.
\end{equation*}
For each location $j \in N_i$ set $\Omega_{i,j} = \Omega_{j,i} = 1$.
For the first $m_L$ locations, $\Omega_{i,i+1} = \Omega_{i+1,1} = 1$ for
$i = 1,\ldots,m_L$.

To define the coordinates for each location, first set $C_{i} =
\lbrace i,0 \rbrace$ for $i = 1,\ldots,m_L$.  Then for each

\caption{\label{fig:alley50}The starred alleyway network with 50 locations}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Ring}
\label{sec-3-1-3}

Divide the number of locations $L$ into two groups.  Define $L_1 = L -
L_2$ where $L_2 = \lceil L*0.05 \rceil$.  Let $\theta = 2\pi/(L_1+1)$
and $r = 1/(2\sin(\theta/2))$.  Place location $1$ at $C_1 = \lbrace
0,r \rbrace$.  Given location $i-1$ at $C_{i-1}$, place location $i$
at $C_i = rot(\theta) C_{i-1}$ for $i = 2,\ldots,L_1$ and
\begin{equation*}
  rot(\theta) = \left[
    \begin{matrix}
      \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta)\\
      \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
    \end{matrix}
  \right]
\end{equation*}
Note that $C_{1} \cdot C_{L_1} = \|C_{1}\| \|C_{L_1}\| \cos(2\theta)$.

With the first $L_1$ locations defined, we need to define the last
$L_2$ locations.  Place location $L_1 + i$ at $C_{L_1 + i} =
rot(\theta/L_2)C_{L_1 + i - 1}$ for $i = 1,\ldots,L_2$.  Note that
$C_{L} \cdot C_{L_1} = \|C_{L}\| \|C_{L_1}\| \cos(\theta)$ and $C_{1}
\cdot C_{L} = \|C_{1}\| \|C_{L}\| \cos(\theta)$.

To define the adjacency matrix, $A_{i,i+1} = A_{i+1,i} = 1$ for $i =
1,\ldots,L-1$ and $A_{1,L} = A_{L,1} = 1$.



\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./data/toy/ringSample.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:ring50}The ring network with 50 locations}
\end{figure}




\subsubsection{Grid}
\label{sec-3-1-4}

First define $L_1$ to be the number of columns and $L_2$ to be the
number of rows.  These values are defined by
\begin{equation*}
  \lbrace L_1, L_2 \rbrace = \underset{
    \begin{subarray}{c}
      \ell_1,\ell_2 > 0\\
      \ell_1\ell_2 = L\\
      \ell_1 \le \ell_2
    \end{subarray}
  }{\arg\min} \quad |\ell_1 - \ell_2|
\end{equation*}

Location $i$ is positioned at $C_i = \lbrace (i \text{ mod } L_2), \lfloor
i/L_2 \rfloor \rbrace$.  The adjacency matrix is defined as $\Omega_{i,j} =
1$ if $\|C_i - C_j\| = 1$.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./data/toy/gridSample.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:grid50}The grid network with 50 locations}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Bowtie}
\label{sec-3-1-5}

The bowtie combines two grid networks with a random network in
between.  Spread of the disease begins in one grid and travels through
the random network and into the other grid.

For a bowtie network of size $L$, create one random network of size
$L_R = \lceil 0.1 L \rceil + ((L - \lceil 0.1 L \rceil) \text{ mod }
2)$ and two grid networks of size $L_G = (L - L_R)/2$.  Let $i_{R}$ be
the $i^{th}$ location in the random network and $i_{G_j}$ be the
$i^{th}$ location in the $j^{th}$ grid.

To connect the three networks, we need to first identify which nodes
in each network will connect to one of the other two networks.  We
will begin with the first grid.  First, define $L_1$ and $L_2$ to be
defined in the same way as in the grid description.  Let $M_{G} =
\lceil L_2/3 \rceil$ be the number of points to connect from the grid
networks and $M_{R} = \lceil L_R/5 \rceil$.  Define the following four
sets of locations
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    \Lambda_{G_1} & = & \lbrace L_G -
                        2L_1M_G + kL_1 : k = 1,\ldots,M_G\rbrace\\
    \Lambda_{G_2} & = & \lbrace L_G -
                        2L_1M_G + 1 + (k-1)L_1 : k =
                        1,\ldots,M_G\rbrace\\
    \Lambda_{R_1} & = & \lbrace i : C_{i_R,1} \le C_{[M_R]_{R},1} \rbrace\\
    \Lambda_{R_2} & = & \lbrace i : C_{i_R,1} \ge C_{[L_R - M_R + 1]_{R},1} \rbrace.
  \end{array}
\end{equation*}

To define the adjacency matrix, combine the adjacency matrices from
the three separate networks as a block diagonal matrix.  To define the
additional edges, set $\Omega_{i_{G_1},j_R} = \Omega_{j_R,i_{G_1}} =
1$ for all $i \in \Lambda_{G_1}$ and $j \in \Lambda_{R_1}$ to connect
the first grid to the random network.  Then set $\Omega_{i_{G_2},j_R}
= A_{j_R,i_{G_2}} = 1$ for all $i \in \Lambda_{G_2}$ and $j \in
\Lambda_{R_2}$ to connect the second grid to the random network.

Now that the adjacency marix is defined, we need to finish the
network.  The last step is scaling and adjusting the coordinates from
the three networks.  We define this as an ordered list of operations.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For $i=1,\ldots,L_R$: $C_{i_{R}} = C_{i_{R}}/2$.
  \item Define $K = (\max_i C_{i_{R},1} - \min_i C_{i_{R},1})/2$.
  \item For $i=1,\ldots,L_R$: $C_{i_{R},1} = C_{i_{R},1} -
  \min_j C_{j_{R},1} + \max_j C_{j_{G_1},1} + K$
  \item For $i=1,\ldots,L_G$:
  $C_{i_{G_2},1} = C_{i_{G_2},1} - \min_j C_{j_{G_2},1} + \max_j
  C_{j_{R},1} + K$.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./data/toy/bowtieSample.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:bowtie50}The bowtie network with 50 locations}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Scalefree}
\label{sec-3-1-6}

The scalefree network is designed so that some locations are highly
connected while others are only connected by a couple edges.  This
type of network was originally desigined to mimic the network of
webpages.  The internet houses many websites that are highly connected
(e.g. Google, Yahoo, etc.) while the majority are not.

To generate the network of size $L$, we will define the process via
induction.  Define $\Omega^{(i)}$ to be the adjacency network on
iteration $i = 1,\ldots,L$.  A network of size $1$ is the trivial
network.  Given a network of size $N-1$, place the additonal $N^{th}$
location adjacent to an existing location $i \in \lbrace
1,\ldots,N-1\rbrace$ with probability
\begin{equation*}
  P(\Omega^{(N)}_{N,i} = 1 | \Omega^{(N-1)}) = 
  \frac{\sum_{j!=i} \Omega^{(N-1)}_{j,i}}{\sum_{j,k \;:\; j > k} \Omega^{(N-1)}_{j,k}}.
\end{equation*}

Generating a scale-free network in this fashion results in a
Barabasi-Network.  The defining feature of a scale-free network is the
proportion of nodes with $k$ edges is proportional to $k^{-\gamma}$
for some $\gamma$.  In a Barabasi-Network $\gamma = 3$.

Given the adjacency matrix, we use the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm
to position the nodes in a two dimensional plane.


\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./data/toy/scalefreeSample.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:scalefree50}The scalefree network with 50 locations}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Covariates}
\label{sec-3-2}

Define $X$ to be a $n \times p$ centered and scaled covariate matrix.
The covariates are multivariate normal $MVN_p(\mu,\Sigma)$ where
$\mu_i = 2\widetilde{C}_{i,1}^2 + 1\widetilde{C}_{i,2}$ and
$\widetilde{C}$ are the centered and scaled coordinates.  The
covariance matrix has the structure $\Sigma_{ip + s, jp + t} =
\rho e^{(-\tau  E_{i,j} - \eta |s-t|)}$.  Thus, the variance of the
individual covariates are $1$ and the correlation decays as $E_{i,j}$
increases and as $|s-t|$ increases.

We need the mass of each individual node to compute the gravity term
in the gravity model.  In the case of White-Nose Syndrome, the mass is
the number of caves.  Arbitrarily set the first covariate to be the
mass of the node.  Define $M_i = \lfloor X_{i,1} - X_{[1],1} \rfloor +
1$ to be the mass of location $i$.


\subsection{Network distance}
\label{sec-3-3}

In order for the structure of the network to have a strong impact on
the disease spread, we define distance as the geodesic distance raised
to a power.  The distance between adjacent nodes ($i$ and $j$ such
that $A_{i,j} = 1$) is defined to be $1$.  For non-adjacent nodes, the
distance is the number of edges along the shortest path raised to a
power.  To determine the appropriate power, let $p^{(1)}_{i,j}$ be the
hypothetical probability node $i$ infects node $j$ where $i$ and $j$
have geodesic distance $1$.  Let $p^{(2)}_{i,j}$ be the hypothetical
probability if infection if $i$ and $j$ have geodesic distance $2$.
For their mass, use the mean mass of the network.  The log odds-ratio
is equal to
\begin{equation*}
  - \frac{\alpha}{m^\rho} + \frac{\alpha2^z}{m^\rho}.
\end{equation*}
Set this equation equal to $\log(0.5)$ and solve for $z$.
