#+title: simulation details

* Simulations
  - [ ] Models
    - [ ] Gravity
    - [ ] Gravity with time infected
    - [ ] Range (only depends on distance)
    - [ ] Cave (only depends on number of caves)
  - [ ] Model specification (generative model is gravity model with best fit)
    - [ ] Correctly specified
    - [ ] Misspecified with range model
    - [ ] Misspecified with cave model
  - [ ] Model fitting
    - [ ] MLE
    - [ ] MCMC
  - [ ] Policies
    - [ ] Stochastic weights
    - [ ] Stohastic weights
      


* Tuning
  - [ ] Model fitting diagnostics (for Gravity models w/ and w/out time
    infected)
    - [ ] MLE
      - [ ] LRT
    - [ ] MCMC
      - [ ] DIC
    - [ ] Both
      - [ ] AIC or BIC
      - [ ] $\sum_{t,i} \| P_M(X_{t,i} = 1) - X^o_{t,i} \|_2$ where
        $t$ is time, $i$ is location, $X$ is infection status, and $M$
        is one of the spread models above.  $P_M(X_{t,i} = 1)$ would
        be estimated empirically and $X^o_{t,i}$ is the observed
        value.
  - [ ] Variance for stochastic weights
    - [ ] For feature $f_i$ let the jitter be $j_i \sim
      N(0,Var(f_i)/c)$.
    - [ ] Compare $c = 2,...,8$ for grid network size 100 and select the
        one that performs the best in terms of estimated value.
